Landing Page Project for TOP

Completed project using Flexbox as the primary method for layout. Trying to get used to chaining classes for styling for more concise code.

This was a good refresher for CSS styling and helped reinforce my understanding of Flexbox and how to incorporate Git into the workflow.

Cheers!
